# Diabetic Health Tracking App

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a user-friendly diabetic health tracking application to help people with diabetes better manage their condition. It addresses challenges like tracking blood glucose levels, meal carb counting, medication reminders, physical activity logging, and data reporting for improved healthcare communication.

## Problem Statement
Managing diabetes effectively requires daily monitoring of glucose levels, meal intake, medication adherence, and exercise, which can be fragmented and overwhelming for patients. This often leads to poor disease management and health outcomes.

## Proposed Solution
Our app offers a comprehensive platform for manually logging blood glucose readings, meals with carbohydrate information, medication and insulin reminders, and physical activity tracking. It also provides data visualization of trends and supports generating reports that can be shared with healthcare providers for better treatment personalization.

## Key Features
- Blood glucose tracking with daily logs and graph visualization
- Meal and carbohydrate intake logging
- Medication and insulin dosage reminders with notifications
- Physical activity tracking related to glucose impact
- Data export functionality in CSV or PDF formats for doctor consultations

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React Native (mobile app) / React.js (web app)
- Backend: Node.js with Express or Azure Functions
- Database: Azure Cosmos DB for scalable, globally distributed user data storage
- Notification Service: Azure Notification Hub for reminders
- Cloud Storage: Azure Blob Storage for storing reports and exported files
- Monitoring & Analytics: Azure Monitor for performance and health tracking

## Next Steps
- Begin setting up repository structure and initial project scaffolding
- Develop core glucose tracking and reminders features
- Integrate Azure Cosmos DB backend
- Implement data visualization and reporting
